### What is Machine Learning?

[Expert AI](https://www.expert.ai/blog/machine-learning-definition/) defines `Machine learning` is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It is the science of using statistical algorithms to train a model with the capabilities of finding patterns from data.

It is the process of training computers, using math and statistical processes, to find and recognize patterns in data. After patterns are found, ML generates and updates training models to make increasingly accurate predictions and inferences about future outcomes based on historical and new data.

ML applications is an iterative process that involves a sequence of steps. To build an ML application, follow these general steps:

Some applications of Machine Learning include:

* Google Translate
* Google Mapsâ€™ Traffic Prediction
* Recommendation Engine
* Spam Detection
* Self-driving Cars
* Speech recognition
* Medical diagnosis
* Statistical arbitrage
* Predictive analytics
* Image Recognition
* Extraction.

Machine learning can ingest limitless amounts of data, produce timely analysis and assessment, identify trends and patterns, and generate predictive forecasts.


### ML vs Rule-Based Systems

Classical programming uses data and static, hand-coded rules to generate results. ML uses historical data or output, combined with new data, to generate new rules in a training model.

### Types of Machine Learning

`Supervised learning` is a method where a model learns from a data set containing input values and paired output values that you would like to predict. Common supervised learning examples are Classification and Regression.

`Unsupervised learning` is a method in which the training model learns from data without any guidance. The objective is pattern and structure recognition. Common examples are
Clustering and Association.

`Reinforcement learning` is a method in which the training model learns from its environment by being rewarded for correct moves and punished for incorrect moves.
